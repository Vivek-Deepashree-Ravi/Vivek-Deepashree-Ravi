### Hi there 👋

# Vivek DR

## Robotic Engineer | ROS Developer

🤖 Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am passionate about robotics, specializing in the development of autonomous systems, path planning, and navigation for both mobile robots and robotic arms using the Robot Operating System (ROS).

### 🔧 Technical Skills

- **Robot Operating System (ROS):** Proficient in designing and implementing ROS-based applications for mobile robots and robotic arms.
- **Path Planning:** Expertise in designing algorithms for efficient and collision-free path planning in dynamic environments.
- **Navigation:** Experience in designing and implementing navigation systems for mobile robots, ensuring reliable and robust real-time performance.
- **Simulations:** Skilled in using simulation tools such as Gazebo and RViz to validate and test robotic systems before deployment.
- **Robot Perception:** Familiar with integrating sensors like LiDAR, cameras, and IMUs for perception and environment understanding.

### 🤖 Project Highlights

#### Mobile Robot Path Planning
- Implemented a global path planning algorithm using A*, DWA planner and RRT* considering dynamic obstacles and optimizing for the shortest path.
- Integrated the path planner with a local navigation system, ensuring smooth and collision-free movement in real-world scenarios.

#### Robotic Arm Motion Planning
- Developed a motion planning system for a robotic arm with 6DOF using Moveit and tesseract motion planner, enabling precise and efficient manipulation tasks.
- Validated the motion planner through simulation and successfully deployed it on a physical robotic arm.
